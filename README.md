# Overview
This repository provides two sets of codes used in the paper titled "Synaptic pruning facilitates online Bayesian model selection."

## BlindSourceSeparation
This folder contains a set of codes to reproduce the results of "Numerical simulation 1: Blind source separation."

"Main_BSS.m" runs a single simulation. "RepeatMain_BSS.m" repeats the simulations and makes figures summarizing the results.

## RuleLearning
This folder contains a set of codes to reproduce the results of "Numerical simulation 2: Rule learning."

"Main_RL.m" runs a single simulation. "RepeatMain_RL.m" repeats the simulations and makes figures summarizing the results.

## Reference
